# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) foundations curriculum.

The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using just HTML. I will create a main index page that links to a few recipes. Each recipe will have its own page with ingredients and preparation steps.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Creating and structuring HTML files
- Using relative paths for linking between pages
- Organizing files in a project directory
- Practicing Git basics (clone, commit, push, etc.)
- Writing semantic HTML

This is a simple yet important milestone to reinforce how to structure and navigate a basic website using core HTML concepts.
